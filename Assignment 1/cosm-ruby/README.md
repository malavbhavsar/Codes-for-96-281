01_dictionary
=========
1. Modify 01_dictionary/dictionary.rb so that this command will pass all of the test cases:
  
  `cd 01_dictionary`
  
  `rspec dictionary_spec.rb`

02_cosm-ruby
=========
1. From the command line run `bundle install` to install the needed ruby gem libraries.
2. Start by getting the tests in `feed_spec.rb` to pass.
3. Then get the tests in `cosm_parser_spec.rb` to pass.

  * Hint to use the json gem then:
  
      `parsed_json = JSON(your_json_string)`
  
  * Hint: see `example_cosm_access_by_http.rb` for connecting to cosm through ruby.
  
3. See a real stream.
=========
If you modify cosm_stream.rb with your API_KEY, then you can see the current live
values with the code you have written

`ruby cosm-stream.rb`
